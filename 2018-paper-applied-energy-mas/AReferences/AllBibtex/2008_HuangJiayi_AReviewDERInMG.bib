abstract = "The distributed energy resources (DER) comprise several technologies, such as diesel engines, micro turbines, fuel cells, photovoltaic, small wind turbines, etc. The coordinated operation and control of \{DER\} together with controllable loads and storage devices, such as flywheels, energy capacitors and batteries are central to the concept of MicroGrid (MG). \{MG\} can operate interconnected to the main distribution grid, or in an islanded mode. This paper reviews the researches and studies on \{MG\} technology. The operation of \{MG\} and the \{MG\} in the market environment are also described in the paper. "
