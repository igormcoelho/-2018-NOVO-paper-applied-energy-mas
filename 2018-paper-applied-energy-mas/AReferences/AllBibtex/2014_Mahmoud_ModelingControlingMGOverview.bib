abstract = "Abstract A microgrid (MG) is a building block of future smart grid, it can be defined as a network of low voltage power generating units, storage devices and loads. System of systems (SoS) is another concept involving large scale integration of various systems. In this paper, we provide an overview of recent developments in modeling and control methods of microgrid as well as presenting the reason towards incorporating \{MG\} into the existing grid. Various SoS control strategies when applied to \{MG\} are discussed. "
