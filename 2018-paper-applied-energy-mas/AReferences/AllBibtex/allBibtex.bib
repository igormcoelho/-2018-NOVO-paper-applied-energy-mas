abstract = "Abstract High share of distributed energy resources (DER) into power systems can significantly modify the net demand profile. Error forecasts of intermittent generation of renewable energy sources (RES) along with the current inelastic behavior of the consumption can provoke considerable network operational issues, such as frequency fluctuations and voltage imbalances. Increasing the noncontrollable \{DER\} penetration in network operation requires increased flexible and dispatchable generation capacity for balancing \{RES\} generation intermittency. Demand response mechanisms can be an efficient and less costly alternative for handling the grid issues posed by high \{RES\} penetration. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate enabling Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and operational tools for distributed demand management mechanism that allows consumers to participate in grid support without affecting their level of satisfaction. An actual household environment called Mas Roig and located in Llagostera, Spain is used to demonstrate and assess the \{ICT\} based demand response mechanism. The results of the implementation are presented and evaluated providing useful insights for a mass deployment of such mechanisms. "

However, connecting \{EVs\} to the distribution network and recharging the \{EV\} batteries without any control may overload the transformers and cables during peak hours when the penetration of \{EVs\} is relatively high. In this study, a two level hierarchical control method for integrating \{EVs\} into the distribution network is proposed to coordinate the self-interests and operational constraints of two actors, the \{EV\} owner and Distribution system operator (DSO), facilitated by the introduction of the fleet operator (FO) and the grid capacity market operator (CMO). Unlike the typical hierarchical control system where the upper level controller commands the low level unit to execute the actions, in this study, market based control are applied both in the upper and low level of the hierarchical system. Specifically, in the upper level of the hierarchy, distribution system operator uses market based control to coordinate the fleet operator׳s power schedule. In the low level of the hierarchy, the fleet operator use market based control to allocate the charging power to the individual EVs, by using market based control, the proposed method considers the flexibility of \{EVs\} through the presence of the response-weighting factor to the shadow price sent out by the FO. Furthermore, to fully demonstrate the coordination behavior of the proposed control strategy, we built a multi-agent system (MAS) that is based on the co-simulation environment of JACK, Matlab and Simulink. A use case of the \{MAS\} and the results of running the system are presented to intuitively illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. "

Without intelligent controls, the full benefits of renewable energy technologies may not be achievable, specifically the ground source heat pump (GSHP) technologies. This was observed, especially by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) that had incorporated a \{GSHP\} to one of its building. The \{GSHP\} is under performing due to the inefficient controls implemented with the GSHP. This paper proposes an intelligent multi-agent building management system (MAS BMS) that aims to tackle this issue. Intelligence is provided by an ARTMAP, a type of artificial neural network that provides incremental learning inspired by how human process memory.

Along with this development come a shift from centralized to distributed production and consumption models as well as discussions about the introduction of variable demand–supply-driven grid electricity prices. Together with upcoming \{ICT\} and automation technologies, these developments open space to a wide range of novel energy management and energy trading possibilities to optimally use available energy resources. However, what is considered as an optimal energy management and trading strategy heavily depends on the individual objectives and needs of a microgrid operator. Accordingly, elaborating the most suitable strategy for each particular system configuration and operator need can become quite a complex and time-consuming task, which can massively benefit from computational support. In this article, we introduce a bio-inspired cognitive decision agent architecture for optimized, goal-specific energy management in (interconnected) microgrids, which are additionally connected to the main electricity grid. For evaluating the performance of the architecture, a number of test cases are specified targeting objectives like local photovoltaic energy consumption maximization and financial gain maximization. Obtained outcomes are compared against a modified simulating annealing optimization approach in terms of objective achievement and computational effort. Results demonstrate that the cognitive decision agent architecture yields improved optimization results in comparison to the state of the art reference method while at the same time requiring significantly less computation time.

When the power supply and demand are imbalanced, the system selects the state-changeable agent as the task initiator according to the load balance principle. In the energy-coordination process, the proposed system solves the global optimal-energy distribution plan of the system by considering the self-constraint and control objective of each agent and by using the improved particle swarm algorithm to achieve the maximum economic benefit on the basis of stable operations. The paper presents the overall design idea of the system, the agent models of different equipment, and the global energy-coordination optimization algorithm. An example is given to discuss the behavior characteristics of the agent and communication negotiation process and to verify that the system designed in this paper can realize the energy-coordination dispatching flexibly and efficiently.

In particular, the microgrids involve a high penetration of variable energy resources that motivate the need for new coordination and control approaches.

These gaps suggest that the microgrid integration challenge is not just under the control of an individual microgrid, but also is in coordination with others. The chapter then presents a novel multi-agent system coordination approach for the resilient self-healing operation of multiple microgrids. An architecture composed of physical agents is presented on a dual platform of \{JADE\} (Java Agent \{DEvelopment\} framework) and MATLAB. The resilience of multiple microgrids is then demonstrated in relation to three types of disturbed operations: (i) highly variable net load, (ii) net load ramp events, and (iii) net load changes during high load levels.

abstract = "This paper proposes a multi-agent system for energy resource scheduling of an islanded power system with distributed resources, which consists of integrated microgrids and lumped loads. Distributed intelligent multi-agent technology is applied to make the power system more reliable, efficient and capable of exploiting and integrating alternative sources of energy. The algorithm behind the proposed energy resource scheduling has three stages. The first stage is to schedule each microgrid individually to satisfy its internal demand. The next stage involves finding the best possible bids for exporting power to the network and compete in a whole sale energy market. The final stage is to reschedule each microgrid individually to satisfy the total demand, which is the addition of internal demand and the demand from the results of the whole sale energy market simulation. The simulation results of a power system with distributed resources comprising three microgrids and five lumped loads show that the proposed multi-agent system allows efficient management of micro-sources with minimum operational cost. The case studies demonstrate that the system is successfully monitored, controlled and operated by means of the developed multi-agent system. "

abstract = "Abstract This paper presents an analysis and systemization of automatic generation control (AGC) in distribution networks (DNs) with high penetration of distributed resources, including electric vehicles (EVs). A methodology is developed that allows designing the \{AGC\} service at the distribution level, and an optimization model is proposed to assess the potential of \{AGC\} provision from \{EVs\} according to an objective of optimal economic management. A realistic case study is considered to analyze the proposed approach, and to illustrate both the potential of the methodology and the effectiveness of the optimization model. Results show that the proposed methodology represents a flexible tool that any system operator could use for the operational planning and the management of ancillary services such as \{AGC\} with EVs.
