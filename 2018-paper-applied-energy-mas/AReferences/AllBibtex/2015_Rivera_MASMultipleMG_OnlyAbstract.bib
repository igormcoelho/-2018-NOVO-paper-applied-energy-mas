abstract = "Abstract Power networks with multiple microgrids require flexibility and versatility in their coordination and decision-making tools, from both technical and economical points of view. In particular, the microgrids involve a high penetration of variable energy resources that motivate the need for new coordination and control approaches. In this chapter, some of the literature gaps with respect to the coordination of multiple microgrids are first identified. These gaps suggest that the microgrid integration challenge is not just under the control of an individual microgrid, but also is in coordination with others. The chapter then presents a novel multi-agent system coordination approach for the resilient self-healing operation of multiple microgrids. An architecture composed of physical agents is presented on a dual platform of \{JADE\} (Java Agent \{DEvelopment\} framework) and MATLAB. The resilience of multiple microgrids is then demonstrated in relation to three types of disturbed operations: (i) highly variable net load, (ii) net load ramp events, and (iii) net load changes during high load levels.
