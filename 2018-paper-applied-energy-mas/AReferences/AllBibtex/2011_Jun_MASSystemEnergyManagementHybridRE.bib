abstract = "This paper presents a multi-agent (MAS) solution to energy management in a distributed hybrid renewable energy generation system. An introduction and analysis of the system, including its constituents, characteristics and excitation mechanism are presented first. Then, validation of the \{MAS\} solution demonstrates its feasibility in meeting all the requirements of the system. Five kinds of agents are proposed to present the Energy Management System. Each agent is built as a three layered architecture. A macro \{MAS\} is also presented in detail with a framework containing its overall optimisation function based on \{JADE\} (Java Agent Development). Discussion about the agentsâ€™ behaviours and a scenario case study on the \{MAS\} and its testing process are included in the paper. It indicates that the \{MAS\} is a suitable solution for the energy management of the distributed hybrid renewable energy generation system. "
