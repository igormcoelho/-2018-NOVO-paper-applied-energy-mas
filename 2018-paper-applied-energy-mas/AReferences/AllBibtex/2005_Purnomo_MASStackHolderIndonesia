CORMAS adopts a multi-agent systems application
specifically designed for renewable resource management.
Multi-agent systems evolved from knowledge-based systems,
which makes it possible to represent ‘‘knowledge and reasoning
of several heterogeneous agents that need to be accommodated
in addressing planning problems in a collective way’’
(Bousquet and Le Page, 2004). A review of its applications
to ecosystem management is reported by Bousquet and Le Page
(2004). An integrated use of CORMAS, Geographic Informa-
tion Systems (GIS), and participatory modelling was developed
for the Senegal River Valley and was reported by Aquino et al.
(2002) as a successful decision aid and local empowerment tool
for dealing with resource management issues such as
sustainable land-use management. CORMAS has also been
the platform used by Purnomo et al. (2005) to develop and
analyse a multi-agent simulation model of a community-
managed forest.



Developing multi-stakeholder forest management scenarios: a multi-agent system simulation approach applied in Indonesia

Participatory approaches to development in general and natural resource management
in particular are now a widely accepted management strategy. Multi-agent system
(MAS), a computer-based tool, offers a promising approach for multi-stakeholder
management systems such as the case involving community-managed resources.
MAS provides a framework where stakeholders (or agents) individual actions,
behaviors and rational decisions can be analyzed in the context of the other
stakeholders actions and decisions. This robust approach offers a convenient analytical
framework that can be used to simulate agents actions, reactions and interactions.
The approach also provides an environment where strategies or multi-stakeholder
forest management scenarios can be developed and analyzed. This paper describes a
MAS model developed for a forest management unit located in East Kalimantan,
Indonesia. Results and experience gained from the case study suggest that MAS is a
suitable approach for developing multi-stakeholder forest management strategies.
