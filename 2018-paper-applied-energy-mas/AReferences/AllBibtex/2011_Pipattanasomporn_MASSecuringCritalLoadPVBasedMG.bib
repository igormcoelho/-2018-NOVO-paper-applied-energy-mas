abstract = "The objective of this paper is to describe the development of a multi-agent system for the control of a PV-based microgrid. A case study is presented to demonstrate the agentsâ€™ abilities to island the PV-based microgrid in the event of an external fault, secure critical loads, and resynchronize the microgrid to the main grid after the fault is cleared. Simulation results indicate that the multi-agent system can isolate and stabilize the PV-based microgrid within half an electrical cycle. During this time interval all non-critical loads are shed according to their priorities while all critical electrical loads are secured. This analysis can serve as a guide for the practical implementation of an agent-based approach for resilient operation of a microgrid that has a solar photovoltaic (PV) system coupled with battery storage.
