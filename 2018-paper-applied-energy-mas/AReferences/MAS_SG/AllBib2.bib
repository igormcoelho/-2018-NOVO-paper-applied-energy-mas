abstract = "Abstract Transient stability, an important issue to avoid the loss of synchronous operation in power systems, can be achieved through proper coordination and operation of protective devices within the critical clearing time (CCT). In view of this, the development of an intelligent decision support system is useful for providing better protection relay coordination. This paper presents an intelligent distributed agent-based scheme to enhance the transient stability of smart grids in light of \{CCT\} where a multi-agent framework (MAF) is developed and the agents are represented in such a way that they are equipped with protection relays (PRs). In addition to this, an algorithm is developed which assists the agents to make autonomous decision for controlling circuit breakers (CBs) independently. The proposed agents are responsible for the coordination of protection devices which is done through the precise detection and isolation of faults within the CCT. The agents also perform the duty of reclosing \{CBs\} after the clearance of faults. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a standard \{IEEE\} 39-bus test system by considering short-circuit faults at different locations under various load conditions. To further validate the suitability of the proposed scheme a benchmark 16-machine 68-bus power system is also considered. Simulation results show that \{MAF\} exhibits full flexibility to adapt the changes in system configurations and increase the stability margin for both test systems. "

However, connecting \{EVs\} to the distribution network and recharging the \{EV\} batteries without any control may overload the transformers and cables during peak hours when the penetration of \{EVs\} is relatively high. In this study, a two level hierarchical control method for integrating \{EVs\} into the distribution network is proposed to coordinate the self-interests and operational constraints of two actors, the \{EV\} owner and Distribution system operator (DSO), facilitated by the introduction of the fleet operator (FO) and the grid capacity market operator (CMO). Unlike the typical hierarchical control system where the upper level controller commands the low level unit to execute the actions, in this study, market based control are applied both in the upper and low level of the hierarchical system. Specifically, in the upper level of the hierarchy, distribution system operator uses market based control to coordinate the fleet operator׳s power schedule. In the low level of the hierarchy, the fleet operator use market based control to allocate the charging power to the individual EVs, by using market based control, the proposed method considers the flexibility of \{EVs\} through the presence of the response-weighting factor to the shadow price sent out by the FO. Furthermore, to fully demonstrate the coordination behavior of the proposed control strategy, we built a multi-agent system (MAS) that is based on the co-simulation environment of JACK, Matlab and Simulink. A use case of the \{MAS\} and the results of running the system are presented to intuitively illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. "

This transition toward a so-called smart grid (SG) requires advanced building energy management systems (BEMS) to cope with the highly complex interaction between two environments. This paper proposes an agent-based approach to optimize the inter-operation of the SG-BEMS framework. Furthermore a computational intelligence technique, i.e. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is used to maximize both comfort and energy efficiency. Numerical results from an integrated simulation show that the operation of the building can be dynamically changed to support the voltage control of the local power grid, without jeopardizing the building main function, i.e. comfort provision.

Generation and transmission have been evolving and improving as they have been under the control of utility companies, but distribution has been lagging behind on some of these improvements, due to the number of stakeholders involved in the process. With the integration of information and communication technology into the electricity distribution, there has been a spike in research and other studies to prepare for the future. In this paper, we analyzed all papers related to the topics of Smart Grids and Distribution. Because of the novelty of the concept, the results validate the expectation of an empirical approach in papers using case studies to simulate or conduct pilot runs of the technologies before their massive implementations. Strategies are mostly driven by the USA, while other countries are focusing on quality improvements of the already strategized initiatives with an efficiency-related goal in mind. Consumer participation is going to play a key role in the near future as it requires developing a new business model with the inclusion of self-generation and selling-back of excess capacity to the utility company.

Firstly, smart grid techniques improve the amount of intermittent renewable generation in power system, increasing the capacity of grid-connected clean energy such as solar energy, wind energy and photovoltaic system. Secondly, smart grid promotes energy saving in power system. The main advantage of smart grid is that it can improve the utilization efficiency of power system and the power consuming efficiency.

The data used is drawn from focus groups with 72 participants, using novel scenario techniques to contextualise smart grid technologies in domestic settings. Two contrasting visions of the smart grid are presented, a centralised system based on current institutional arrangements, and an alternative system in which decentralisation of generation and control is pursued. Using the concepts of ‘energy consumer’ and ‘energy citizen’, the paper considers what forms of engagement are likely to be generated by the two visions. We propose that smart grid designs must look beyond simply the technology and recognise that a smart user who is actively engaged with energy is critical to much of what is proposed by demand side management. We conclude that the energy citizen holds out most promise in this regard. The implications of this for policy makers are discussed. "

This paper presents a novel system reserve provision agent which is incorporated into a stochastic market optimization problem. The agent for the system reserve provision uses the SA-Q-learning algorithm to learn how much system reserve to offer at different times, while seeking to increase the ratio between their economic costs and benefits. The agent and its learning process are described in detail and are tested on the \{IEEE\} Reliability test system.

The importance of distributed generation systems has increased through recent years and questions of grid stability have emerged in the face of high concentrations of non-dispatchable power sources. Numerous proposals for “smart” distribution systems have emerged, including an architecture called the Energy Hub (E-Hub), which is a smart microgrid where both thermal and electrical power are supplied to customers by a mix of generator systems. The problem deals with a constrained Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) optimization problem. This paper describes work underway on a real E-Hub located at the laboratories of the Thermochemical Power Group (TPG) of the University of Genoa (UNIGE), Italy. The \{TPG\} E-Hub is being integrated into a larger smart polygeneration grid under construction on the Savona campus of \{UNIGE\} as part of the European Union Resilient project. The proposed control approach aims to optimize the loading of various resources of the E-Hub in response to changing electrical and thermal demands from the campus-wide smart grid. This paper presents some of the results from initial testing of this approach to E-Hub control. "

Microgrids coalitions can (1) minimize the energy burden and dependency on the utility grid, (2) minimize the overall grid network power loss, and (3) maximize intra-coalition energy transfer. In order to form cooperative microgrids, a Hierarchical priority based Coalition Scheme (HRCoalition) is proposed. Given an intra-coalition distance threshold, the proposed \{HRCoalition\} mechanism can provide the optimal coalition that achieves the aforementioned objectives. The optimality is realized by reaching a state of cooperative equilibrium for all microgrids and coalitions. The optimality of the formed coalitions is proved by Coalitional Game Theory. A Greedy based strategy is designed to perform network constrained energy exchange (GreedEnEx) within a formed coalition. Thus, \{HRCoalition\} provides a higher level optimization while, GreedEnEx yields system level optimization using output of HRCoalition. The proposed \{HRCoalition\} scheme is computationally very efficient and can scale up to a huge number of microgrids and thus makes it suitable for near real-time operation. An equivalent pricing mechanism is designed to provide a form of economic incentive to the microgrids participating coalition formation. The performance of the proposed method is reported to scale up to 500 microgrids with a loss reduction ranging from 26% to 80%. The provided numerical simulation results back the claim of optimality as well as prove the effectiveness of the proposed coalition formation method. "

This paper presents the design of multi-agent based demand response program while considering ac network constraints. This project develops two types of information sharing and iterative decision making procedures for the utility and communities to reach Nash equilibrium. The distributed algorithms of decision making are based on Lagrangian relaxation, duality, and the concept of upper and lower bounds. The first algorithm is subgradient iteration based distributed decision making algorithm and the second algorithm is based on lower bound and upper bound switching. The two algorithms require different information flow between the utility and communities. With the adoption of distributed algorithms, the utility solves optimal power flow at each iteration while considering ac network constraints, and the communities also conduct optimization. Through information sharing, the utility and the communities update their decisions until convergence is reached. The decision making algorithms are tested against three test cases: a distribution network \{IEEE\} 399 system, two meshed networks (IEEE 30-bus system and \{IEEE\} 300-bus system). Fast convergence is observed in all three cases, which indicates the feasibility of the demand response design. "
